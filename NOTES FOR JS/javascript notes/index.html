    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>How to create a Javascript file and how to link the javescript file. Javascript reads from top to bottom(in the code section). You'll want to page to load first and then load your funtionalities. This matters because you might have an interaction that is dependant on the HTML, but if the Javascript loads first it could break the button.</p>

    <h2 class="point">Data types</h2>
    <p>We have data types to help solve equations. Different data types can change the outcome based on how they're written.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <span>String-</span> collections of symbols or words surrounded by quotations. can be used with-in another tag "this is a string" Strings add groups together, like "3"+"1"= "31" or "molly"+"champ"="mollychamp" </li>
        <li><span>Numbers-</span> numbers are numbers. 1,2,3,4,6,-8,4.15 </li>
        <li><span>Boolean-</span>techincal term for true or/false</li>
        <li> <span>Objects</span> are a data type used to store multiple {key:value,key:value,ect} pairs the key is a referable name cooerlating to the value. the value is what ever data type is assigned.</li>
        <li> <span>Arrays-</span>otherwise known as lists, values side by side without any key to single it out. to select an item out of an array, you would grab its index(or position it is in the list. ie 0th,1st,2nd,3rd)  </li>
        <li> <span>-</span>  </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="point">Variables</h2>
    <p>A varible is applied to a data type to define or change that specfic data type by that varible. EX. 2X+3= the x is your varible that defines the nummber to but you can define any value with in x to chand the outcome of the equation to store information, it would be defined in a variable</p>
    <h4>different ways to define a varible</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Let-</span> when you want the varible able to show change</li>
            <li><span> Const-</span>  when the varible should not show change</li>
    </ul>
</div>
    <div class="console">
    <h2 class="point">The JavaScript Console</h2>
    <p> a place that displays messages about a web application. But is not intended for web user viewing. example: error messages that the developer finds of use-- like if an application is taking longer than 20secs to do something important, there will me a message displayed in the console from the log statement that the developer can refectify. </p>
    <ul>
    <li> <span>Console.log </span>is a fuction that allows you to display information on the console. i would use console.log when i want to see the current functionality of the JS code.Is invisible to the user. in not content on the site, its a way to test your code.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Girl, gimme a sec. Here are the content break outs</h4>
    <ul class="types">
    <li><span>Alert-</span> is similar to a console.log, but it displays the information to both the user and the developer. creates a pop up, but does not display in the console. </li>
    <li><span>Prompt-</span> is a function that asks the user in a pop up to enter information. is not self storing</li>
    <li> <span></span></li>
    
    </ul>
