                <li>margin- is the space between the element and everything else. (its pushing stuff away) </li>
                <li> Border- is on the edge of content. by default it is transparent and 0 px wide. to code border you do border: size style color</li>
                <li>padding- is the spacing between the content and its border</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="pos">Lets Talk about Positions</h3>
        <p> Possitions are where Itmes are placed on the screen. differnt types of positions include
            <Ul>
                <li>Static-what everything is defaulted. not a set position and flows with the page. </li>
                <li>Relative- Allows you to visually move something away from the place it would normally line up. EX. if you gave something a relative left postion, it would appear that distance from the left side of the screen.Visually moves the content but the existing space is reserved.</li>
                <img src="../../images/relative postion.png">
                <li>Fixed- fixes an item to a certain point on the screen. think accesibility button lower right side. Even when you scroll the button stays in position. Does not gap the space.</li>
                <li>Absolute-absolutly positioned where directed in another OGitem. OGItem must have defined position of its own, otherwise the abosulted item would default to fixed.</li>
                <li>Sticky- sticks to the boder of the screen when you scroll, returns to normal postion when passing through the other way</li>
                
            </Ul>
