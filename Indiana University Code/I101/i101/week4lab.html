                <p>About 20 miles north of Martinsville, I grew up on a little road called Persimmon Tree Lane. There I
                    didn't grow up with computers, stable internet access, or cable television. Instead, I was able to
                    train horses, hang out with the cows, and learn to identify and appriciate natures beauty. To have a
                    sky so dark at night, that the stars were your light source. To walk outside and smell the dew on
                    the grass and the manure of the farm. It was Home. </p>

                <img class="thirds" src="./images/molly.jpg" alt="a golden-doodle">
                <p> Molly is a golden doodle That I adopted with my roomates in 2020. When we split up she bcame soley
                    my dog. She is almost 5 years old and a complete baby! Think of a teddy bear, all fluff and
                    cuddles-- but no brain!</p>

                <h2>Champ</h2>
                <img class="thirds" src="./images/champ.jpg" alt="an orange tabby cat">
                <p> Champion was my first pet. I got him as a ktten, he was a gradution gift back in 2018(im aging
                    myself). He is the sweetest cat and loves to play! Watch out if you me-ow back, you better be
                    prepared to have a conversation. </p>

                <p> Harper is the newest addition to my life! She was orginally my fiance's dog, but has quickly fit in
                    with the pack! Just look at those wrinkles!! </p>

                <h3> The Conclusion</h3>
                <p> While I didn't spend much time in martinsville the city-- growing up in the country gave me the
                    opportunity to connect with nature and explore nature.</p>
